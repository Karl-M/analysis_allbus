# Repo for analysis of allbus 204 survey with focus on missing data

## Problem

Many cases of missing data are not getting further investigated and become simply ignored. The task is to find out, wether this is possible (if there are no systematic differences between people who answer questions and people who dont), or not.

An additional problem is, that the allbus survey was coding the same missing with different numbers, and that these missings are not getting recognized from R.
